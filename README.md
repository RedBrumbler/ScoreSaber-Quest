# ScoreSaber Quest

ScoreSaber implementation for Quest.

Currently should be almost 1:1 to the PC version of ScoreSaber, though some features are missing / different which can be seen [here](https://github.com/ScoreSaber/ScoreSaber-Quest/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afeature-parity)

If you are a user looking to install ScoreSaber on their Quest, please do not use the `qmod` in the Releases section of this page, this will not work as it is missing the generated authentication code needed for ScoreSaber to work. **Instead please [click here](https://scoresaber.com/quest) for a guided installation process.**
